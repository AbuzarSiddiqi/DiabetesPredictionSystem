# DiabetesPredictionSystem

The Diabetes Prediction System is a JavaScript-based project designed to predict diabetes risk using a pre-defined dataset. It applies rule-based conditions and logical operations to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on input parameters like glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure. The system runs entirely on the client-side, ensuring quick and efficient predictions without requiring AI or machine learning models.

Key Features:
	•	JavaScript-Based – Runs in the browser without external dependencies.
	•	Pre-Defined Dataset – Uses a structured dataset for prediction.
	•	Rule-Based Classification – Applies conditional logic for diabetes detection.
	•	User-Friendly Interface – Simple input fields for easy data entry.
	•	Instant Results – Provides immediate feedback based on input values.

Applications:
	•	Educational Projects – Ideal for students learning JavaScript and data handling.
	•	Health Awareness – Helps users understand diabetes risk factors.
	•	Web-Based Implementation – Can be integrated into websites for quick predictions.

This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used for data-driven decision-making while providing a simple yet effective approach to diabetes prediction.
